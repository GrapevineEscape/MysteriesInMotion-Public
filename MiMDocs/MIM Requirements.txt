Mysteries in Motion (MiM) — Part One: Performer Management

1. Overview
Mysteries in Motion (MiM) is a web application for managing an online murder mystery troupe based in Grapevine, Texas. The app serves:

Performers: register, maintain profiles, apply for roles (Admin must approve), see upcoming shows, mark rehearsal availability (when fully cast), review scripts, and track performance history.
Directors: are also Performers in the system but designated as “Director” for a specific Show Date. They have extra visibility into the show’s details without necessarily having an acting role.
Admins: manage the entire system—adding shows, roles, calendar entries, and approving or rejecting role applications.
A future Part Two will address a customer-facing sales interface, reusing much of the data from Part One.

2. Key Definitions
Show: A murder mystery production that may have multiple performance dates.
Show Role: A character/part within a Show (e.g., “Detective,” “Villain”).
Show Date: A specific instance of performing the Show (e.g., “April 19th, 2025” at 7 PM).
Rehearsal Date: A scheduled time(s) for rehearsals, attached to a particular Show Date.
Admin: The user with full management rights (initially only one).
Performer: An actor in the system. Also used as the base for a Director account if an Admin designates them to direct.
Director: A Performer selected by the Admin to oversee a particular Show Date. They see everything a Performer sees but do not necessarily have an acting role.
Main Calendar: Displays Show Dates (Draft, Open, Fully Cast, Closed, Canceled).
Sub-Calendar: A “show-specific” calendar page that displays Rehearsal Dates (light blue) and the Show Date (light purple), with either read-only or interactive availability entry.
3. User Types & Logging
3.1 Admin (Administrator)
Count: One initial Admin account (possible future additions out of scope).
Tokenized Account: Ensures secure sessions.
Logging:
Writes to admin.log.
Captures login success/failure, password changes, major data changes (e.g., show creation, date updates, role approvals).
3.2 Performer
Count: Potentially many.
Tokenized Accounts: Each performer’s session is secured.
Logging:
Writes to performer.log.
Logs include login success/failure, password changes, concurrency collisions, and major data changes (accepting dates, editing profile).
Each log line includes the performer’s email.
3.3 Director as a Special Performer
Designation: The Admin chooses a Performer from the Performer List and marks them as Director for a specific Show Date.
Behavior:
Directors have all visibility that a Performer would have if they were part of that show, including access to the Show Details <DATE> page.
Directors do not require an approved role to see these details. Their director status gives them the right to view.
They can see (and possibly comment on) rehearsal availability, but do not necessarily take an acting slot.
Important: No performer can simply pick an unassigned role. They must first be “approved” by an Admin or have applied for a role that the Admin accepts.

Admin Banner: Light Grey left nav.

7. Sub-Calendar for Rehearsals
Rather than cluttering the Main Calendar, each Show Date may have a Sub-Calendar for rehearsals:

Access:

Admin/Director/Approved Performers click on the Show Date in the main calendar.
A new page (or modal) shows the Sub-Calendar for that specific Show Date’s rehearsals.
Read-Only vs. Interactive:

Before the show date is fully cast (or if the performer is not approved), it’s read-only.
Once the show date has a Director and is Fully Cast, the Sub-Calendar is interactive for those in the show (approved performers + Director). They can mark availability.
Data Storage:

Each rehearsal date is a “child” event tied to the parent show date.
Light Blue = Rehearsal event(s).
Light Purple = Performance date for that show.
8. Show Details <DATE> Pages
8.1 Show Details <DATE> (Admin + Director View)
Display Conditions:
A Director is assigned (chosen from the Performer list).
At least one Rehearsal Date is configured.
The show date is “Fully Cast.”
Where It Appears: As “Show Details <DATE>” in the left nav once these conditions are met.
Contents:
Show Name / Date / Time / Director
All Performers: Show each performer’s status:
IN PROGRESS (has not recorded availability for all rehearsals)
COMPLETE (has recorded availability for every rehearsal)
Sub-Calendar:
Light Blue = Rehearsals, Light Purple = Show Date
Show Notes - Admin
Print Rehearsal Schedule: Summaries of each rehearsal date/time plus each performer’s availability status.
Director can see all the same info an Admin sees here (except for any truly admin-only controls like “Delete Show,” if that’s out of scope). But the Director is not an actor role—just an overseeing Performer.

8.2 Show Details <DATE> (Performer Side)
Also triggered once the show date is Fully Cast, a Director is assigned, and at least one Rehearsal Date exists.
Read-Only if Not Approved: Performers who are not cast can still see the rehearsal schedule but cannot interact.
Contents:
Show Name / Date / Time / Director
Performer’s Own Status: IN PROGRESS until they respond to all rehearsals, COMPLETE once done.
Sub-Calendar (like Admin’s but limited to the performer’s own availability input):
Each rehearsal date (light blue) can be clicked to choose Available, Unavailable (note required), or Partial (note required).
Once submitted, the date changes color (blue → purple).
Show Notes - Admin (read-only).

Script Version Revert: Not supported; old scripts are for Admin reference only.
Deleted Shows: Vanish without a trace from the system.
No Auto-Notifications on Admin Editing Performer Data: Out of scope.
Admin vs. Performer Collision Logging: Out of scope except concurrency is logged in performer.log.
Director = Performer: Admin designates a performer as Director for a given Show Date, granting them additional show visibility.
11. Final Notes
Part One: This specification covers everything from user registration and profile management to show creation, role approval, and a two-layer calendar system (main calendar for performances, sub-calendar for rehearsals).
Director as a performer with special visibility clarifies how each show can be managed from both administrative and leadership perspectives.
Future: Part Two will build upon these data structures for a customer-facing sale page.
